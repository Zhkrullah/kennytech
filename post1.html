      <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
     
      <p>
        Welcome to my first post! In this article, I’ll talk about how I started my tech journey, what inspired me,
        and what I'm building next with KennyTech. Stay tuned for some tech tips, web development hacks, and motivational nuggets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building from scratch isn’t easy — but it’s worth it. I started with HTML and CSS, and slowly added JavaScript and real-world projects.
        What matters is staying consistent and being part of a learning community. Let’s grow together.
