        Web development is more than just writing code. It's about solving problems, delivering user value, and constantly improving. Whether you're a beginner or a growing frontend wizard, here are a few golden tips to level up:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Master the Basics First</h3>
      <p>
        Before diving into React, Vue, or Tailwind, make sure your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals are solid. These are the foundation of everything in web development.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Make Your Websites Responsive</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile users are the majority today. Use media queries, flexible grids, and relative units like `%` and `em` to make your layout shine on every screen size.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Use Developer Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Chrome DevTools is your best friend. Inspect elements, debug JavaScript, test responsiveness ‚Äî it‚Äôs all there.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Keep Code Clean & Organized</h3>
      <p>
        Use meaningful class names, indent consistently, and avoid writing code that only you can understand. Your future self will thank you.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Keep Learning & Building</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to grow is by building projects. Start small and keep improving. Read documentation, follow tutorials, and contribute to real problems.
